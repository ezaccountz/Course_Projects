      "the club is a few doors down from rei in the corner of a strip mall, plenty of parking and w/easy freeway access.  \n",
      "\n",
      "the main entrance to the club is through a small smoking patio ringed by misters with a half dozen high tables, roll out \u001b[1m[BAR]\u001b[0m, and on this particular night, an ice block \"luge\" for taking shots.   off to the side there's a hole in the wall pizza \u001b[1m[PLACE]\u001b[0m that you can enter without having to leave the patio. \n",
      "\n",
      "i love being outside on the patio during the warm desert summer nights, so having the patio is a plus for me.  it's also an opportunity to give your ears a break from high volume levels when the band is playing.   the water pump for the misters should probably be moved up on the roof and out of earshot however.  listening to that thing hammer away all night takes away from some of the ambience. \n",
      "\n",
      "inside the club i remember it being exceedingly *dark*, which suits me just fine.  from what i could make out in the blackness, the decor was spartan, understated, and more or less contemporary.  the men's room smelled bad, but it wasn't a disaster.  there was no lock on the door though, god forbid you had to drop an \"emergency deuce\" cause you'd be putting on a show for all the bystanders outside.  overall, the \u001b[1m[PLACE]\u001b[0m is pretty nice and not your typical shithole \u001b[1m[MUSIC]\u001b[0m dive.\n",
      "\n",
      "there is a full \u001b[1m[BAR]\u001b[0m and a decent selection of beers on tap, but the major downside here is that draft beers are served in clear plastic cups.   so my first drink of the night, a kiltlifter draft, got warm prematurely.  after that i switched to a shot of hornitos sauza to sip while knocking back a salvo of pacificos for the rest of the night.  i didn't have any mixed drinks so i can't comment on how the pour is.  beers were $4 iirc, wells approx $5.   door cover is usually ~$5-10 weekend nights, $15 for out of town acts, no cover weeknights.  \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "so far as the crowd goes, it was a good mix, easily more than half female, undoubtedly due in part to the good looks of lead singer shelby james.   i'd say it was mostly late 20s-30s.  everybody we talked to was cool, no attitudes, creepiness or aggression from what i could tell, aside from a brief spat of drama with a couple of girls out on patio later in the night. the \u001b[1m[STAFF]\u001b[0m was friendly, good humored, and attractive.\n",

      "prices are not really memorable, but like anywhere, can vary depending on boozes preferred. the patio is pretty big, able to be smoked and drunken on. \n",
